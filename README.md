# SharkPredictor_NASAHackton2025_Project
A global shark presence prediction and mapping system combining satellite data (MODIS, SWOT, and PACE) with an environmental probability mathematical model, implemented in Python using Google Colab and integrated with Google Earth Engine.

Project: Shark Occurrence Prediction – NASA Hackathon 2025

This project aims to generate global probability maps of shark occurrences using satellite data: chlorophyll (PACE), sea surface temperature (MODIS), and wave height (SWOT). The final index combines these variables into a mathematical formula that estimates the likelihood of shark presence, allowing identification of high-risk or conservation-interest areas.

The code processes the data and produces both static and interactive maps, highlighting regions with higher index values (0–1). The interactive map uses the Turbo color scale (blue → red) to indicate probability intensity.

This project provides a powerful visual tool for researchers, environmental agencies, and conservation planners, helping protect marine ecosystems and contributing to biodiversity studies and coastal safety.

Key outcomes:

Global probability maps of shark presence.

Combined index of chlorophyll, temperature, and wave height.

Interactive and exportable visualizations in HTML and PNG.

Robust methodology that can be updated with new satellite data.
